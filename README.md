The purpose of this assignment is to gain practical experience with jQuery UI and implement a partial version of the Scrabble game using drag-and-drop functionality. While it doesn't provide a complete playable Scrabble game, it fulfills most of the requirements outlined in the assignment rubric.

Key features of this program include:

1. Implementation of a bag class that manages the correct number of game pieces. Pieces are randomly drawn from the bag and removed from the available pool.
2. Utilization of jQuery UI draggable functionality to enable dragging of game pieces onto the board tiles.
3. Identification of the letter tile dropped onto the board using the dropped tile ID.
4. Incorporation of four bonus squares on the board.
5. Accurate calculation of scores by determining the placement of each game piece on the board, verifying adjacency, and considering multipliers for cumulative value calculation.
6. The ability for players to continue playing until they are out of all available tiles, with an option to restart the game.
7. Clearing the board, including scores, when restarting the game mid-play or after completion.
8. After playing a word, only the necessary number of letter tiles are selected to replenish the player's "hand" back to 7 tiles.
9. Proper tracking and accumulation of the game score throughout the gameplay.
10. Only allows the tile to be dragged solely from the rack to the Scrabble board, with tiles bouncing back to the rack if dropped elsewhere.
11. Flexibility for users to place tiles to the left or right of existing letters without gaps.
12. User-friendly option to restart the game at any point.


While working on this assignment, I conducted extensive research to gather the necessary information and resources. The professor provided helpful reference links that served as a starting point. I also utilized resources like W3Schools, Stack Overflow, GeeksforGeeks, and the official jQuery website to explore specific topics and find solutions to any difficulties I encountered.
